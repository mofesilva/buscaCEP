# busca_cep

This is a very simple app that is meant to be a training exercise. The idea is to learn once and for all how to send an http request to a public API with a brazilian zip code and return the address of that zip code.

RegEx was used to validate if the zip code input is valid, that is, containing 5 numbers, a (-) and 3 more numbers, this being the format: 00000-000.

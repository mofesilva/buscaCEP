# busca_cep

This is a very simple app that is meant to be a training exercise. The idea is to learn once and for all how to send an http request to a public API with a brazilian zip code and return the address of that zip code.

Some of the things done on this project that was also new was using RegEx to validate is the type zip code is valid, containing 5 numbers a (-) and 3 more numbers, like this format: 00000-000.
